# Select database
USE asimps53tadb;

# 1 - Create a view that shows the TA's first name, last name and all 
# the coruse numbers, years and terms for every course they TA'ed.
CREATE VIEW taCourseView AS
SELECT ta.fname, ta.lname, course.cname, assignedTo.year, assignedTo.term
	FROM ta
		LEFT JOIN assignedTo
			on assignedTo.taID=ta.westernID
		LEFT JOIN course
			on assignedTo.courseCode=course.courseCode;
# Demonstrate view
SELECT * FROM taCourseView;

# 2 - Delete any instructor with the first name of 'Hanan'
DELETE FROM prof WHERE fname="Hanan";

# 3 - Delete the instructor with first name Doug and last name Vancise.
# Note: If he can't be deleted, show what must be done to delete him.
# Delete any co-supervising relationships he has:
DELETE FROM coSupervisedBy 
	WHERE profID IN (SELECT westernID FROM prof WHERE fname="Doug" and lname="Vancise");
# Make myself the supervisor of anyone he is the head supervisor of:
UPDATE ta SET superID="asimps53"
	WHERE profID IN (SELECT westernID FROM prof WHERE fname="Doug" and lname="Vancise");
# Now delete Doug Vancise from the database:
DELETE FROM prof
	WHERE fname="Doug" and lname="Vancise";

# 4 - BONUS
# Do not allow course instances to be created with a year before 2000 or after 2029.
CREATE TRIGGER check_date BEFORE INSERT ON courseInstance
IF NEW.year > 2029 THEN
	SET NEW.year = 2029
END IF
IF NEW.year < 2000 THEN
	SET NEW.year = 2000
END IF;
# Demonstrating that it works.
INSERT INTO courseInstance values("Fall", "2035", "CS1033", "65000");
INSERT INTO courseInstance values("Fall", "1845", "CS1033", "0");
# Print out the table
SELECT * FROM courseInstance;
